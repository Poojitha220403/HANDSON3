Cloud-Docker Hands-On (Week 03)
Steps to Follow:
1. Start by creating a new project folder in VS Code.
2. Add the key files:
  * app.py
  * Dockerfile
  * compose.yaml
  * requirements.txt
3. Fix any syntax issues in app.py and clean up the indentation in compose.yaml.
4. Open Docker Desktop, launch a terminal, and move into the project folder.
5. Build and run the application with: docker compose up

What I Learned:
--> How to pull and run a PostgreSQL image inside a Docker container.
--> The process of building a Flask app, containerizing it with Docker, and running it smoothly.
